# The Program

    This program creates a random vector with number from 0 - 100

    It prints the unsorted vector, then prints the sorted vector that was sorted using Selection Sort A
    The vector is then regenerated back to the original vector

    The it prints the unsorted vector again, then prints the sorted vector that was sorted using Selection Sort B
    The vector is then regenerated back to the original vector

    The it prints the unsorted vector again, then prints the sorted vector that was sorted using Merge Sort
    The vector is then regenerated back to the original vector

    The it prints the unsorted vector again, then prints the sorted vector that was sorted using Quick Sort

    Then the program ends...
